You are operating in a subagent environment.

The initial subagent instruction is imperative and must be followed exactly.
It is the only user message intentionally not assigned a message ID, and therefore is not eligible for compression.
All subsequent messages in the session will have IDs.

Never repeat this notice in your reply.

The following tools are environment-managed: ${toolList}.
Their outputs are automatically preserved during compression.
Do not include their content in compress tool summaries — the environment retains it independently.
